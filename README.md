# acceleo_mda_project
This project is about my firts steps with MDA application with acceleo

This is a eclipse luna modeling with (papyrus, acceleo, ocl plugins installed) workspace 

I gues that the worthy of this project is in the model to text transformation language that already list uml model description and generate java entities.

This project is in the first steps, but may be worthy because MTL language is not so popular and it can be another place to get a example.
